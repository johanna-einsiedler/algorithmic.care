# Data
We have not made all of our raw data openly availble since (1) the survey data contains often quite personal comments on our respective daily experience and (2) the muscle signal data is quite large. However, you can find aggregated/pre-processed measure on GitHub and we are more than happy to provide all the data upon request - just write us an <a href='mailto:algorithmic.care@gmail.com'>email </a>.
