# About the project

"Do Algorithms Care?" is an interdisciplinary collaborative project between artist Amanda Bennetts and data scientist Johanna Einsiedler, investigating the intersection of technology, art, and data science. At the core of this project is an n=1 study, typically challenged in scientific circles for its limited generalizability. Using a DIY smartwatch and integrated external EMG (electromyography) and MMG (mechanomyogram) biosensors, the collaborators engage in self-monitoring to collect their physiological data. This personalized data collection reflects a methodological shift in research practices, emphasizing the need for individual agency in the management and use of bio data. The smartwatch’s integration with a custom AI model — developed to analyze the bio data — aims to predict fatigue. Bennetts, who has a rare muscle disease, sought to understand her bio data's focal points, untethered from the normative metrics often exploited in data collection. 

The artistic dimension of the project  is realized in an installation that mimics a tech store, turning a critical lens on the commercialization of personal data. This environment not only displays the smartwatch and visualizes the study’s findings but also engages visitors in a dialogue about the political and ethical implications of biometric data usage, serving as both a critique and a call to action, urging visitors to reconsider the control they relinquish over their personal data. 

The project is part of the [Founding Lab of the International Transformation University Linz](https://it-u.at/en/).


# About the people





[Johanna Einsiedler](www.johannaeinsiedler.com) is a PhD student in Social Data Science at the University of Copenhagen. Her primary area of research are applications of network science methods and machine learning algorithms in the Social Sciences. Through her collaboration with artist Amanda Bennetts she wants to explore if and how algorithms can be used to improve an individual’s wellbeing and advocate for more DIY technology development.


[Amanda Bennetts](https://www.amandabennetts.art/) is an Australian new media and installation artist. Living with a progressive neurological disease, Bennetts draws on her experience to critically dissect issues relating to care, sickness and disability. Examining what it means to be an ill-body in the world, Bennetts navigates a realm of living that is politically charged and socially determined. She creates large installations that engage materiality, incorporating video, sound and mass-produced objects, often with clinical and disability aesthetics.
